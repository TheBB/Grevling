# Configuration

Grevling configuration is written in the
[Gold language](https://github.com/TheBB/Gold).
This is a *programmable configuration language*, meaning that it supports
conventional programming language features such as defining functions, sharing
and importing data to and from other files, and so on. In this context, a
`grevling.gold` file is a *program* whose output is a JSON-like object, which is
the actual configuration read by Grevling.
